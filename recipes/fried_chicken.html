    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy fried chicken.
         This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints <br>I have heard over the years. 
        It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method!</p>

    <p>This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why?
         It combines all the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest,<br>
          most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time.</p>     


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use).<br>
             Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag
             and shake to coat well.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. 
            LET SIT UNTIL THE <br>FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.</li>
        <br> 
        <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes
            (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). <br>Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts.
             <br>Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>
    </ol>
