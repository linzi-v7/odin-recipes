    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Throughout the Middle East and parts of the Mediterranean, hot tea is a comfort, a social drink, and a means of getting to know one another.</p>

    <p>In that part of the world, including Egypt where I grew up, Shai or Arabic tea is an integral part of hospitality.
         Stop by someone's home or office,<br>even for a few minutes, they'll offer you a seat and a warm cup of mint tea. Most business deals, conversations, family gatherings, heck,
          even <br>marriage proposals happen around a pot of tea â€” often served with a little dessert like a piece of baklava,
        cake, cookies or even something like <br>a biscotti or chocolate tahini date bars.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tea leaves</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp Sugar</li>
        <li>1/8 cup Milk (Optional)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Water</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil Water.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and your tea leaves in a cup.</li>
        <li>Pour the boiled water in the cup.</li>
        <li>Add milk if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
